			<p>University Laboratory High School – or “Uni” as it is better known – is one of the great public high schools in
			the United States. It began in 1876 as a college preparatory school for the University of Illinois. In 1910 it was
			additionally charged to be a laboratory school for the study of applied methods of teaching. As such, Uni
			provides a balanced educational program for intellectual, creative, social, and physical development.
			Uni High is a public school; however, as a unit within the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Uni is
			not supported by local property tax dollars. As a result, Uni must receive support from other sources. The State
			Board of Education provides the greatest portion of funds through legislative funding guidelines passed in 1983.
			The University of Illinois provides building maintenance, utilities, some salary support, and other services.
			Since Uni does not receive local property tax dollars, parents are asked to make a donation to help support the
			annual budget. Currently, private donations provide 30% of Uni High’s budget. Voluntary financial support
			from parents ensures that the experiences of today’s students match those of our remarkable graduates.</P>

			<p><strong>Information About Uni</strong><br>
			Uni offers a five-year <u>accelerated</u> high school curriculum that begins with the subfreshman year - a combination
			of the seventh and eighth grades. Requirements are the following:
			<ul>
			<li>Five years of English;</li>
			<li>Two consecutive years of French, German, Japanese, Latin, or Spanish;</li>
			<li>Four years of mathematics, science, and social studies;</li>
			<li>Five years of fitness conditioning in physical education;</li>
			<li>One and a half years of arts (including the subfreshman interrelated arts program that includes art,
			drama, and music);</li>
			<li>One year of computer science (including the subfreshman interdisciplinary Computer Literacy course);
			and</li>
			<li>Required health course; and</li>
			<li>Completion of Consumer Education on-line course.</li></ul>

			<p>Uni students have the opportunity to select other courses to add depth and breadth to their requirements. For example, during the senior year, the Senior Project, as an elective course, affords students the opportunity for self-directed learning on campus or in the community.
			Additionally, Uni students who are at least 15 years old and have earned a “B” average may enroll concurrently
			in University of Illinois courses. Uni students are also eligible to work on independent study projects with
			UIUC professors and to take courses concurrently at Parkland College. Ninety-nine percent of Uni students
			attend four-year colleges or universities across the U.S. Several graduates each year defer admission to a four-year
			institution in order to study abroad, travel or volunteer.</p>

			<p>Uni students also participate in a wide variety of school activities, and students may start new clubs related to
			their special interests after securing faculty sponsorship and Student Council approval. Membership in clubs is
			open to all students. Students assist the school through elected service on the Student Council and the Student-
			Faculty Advisory Committee. The arts and athletic programs at Uni are among the most extensive in the country
			for schools of similar size. The athletic program practices a “no-cut” policy that allows any student to
			participate in competitive athletics. The fine arts programs in music, drama, and art offer similar opportunities
			for students of various levels of talent. More than 66 percent of the students at Uni play on interscholastic
			teams, and more than 70 percent of the students at Uni participate in fine arts activities. During the year, Uni
			students sponsor several school-wide programs. For example in February, during Agora Week, Uni students,
			parents, teachers, alumni and community experts have the opportunity to take or teach classes that represent the
			broad interests of the Uni community. This allows students to introduce themselves to new topics and
			experiences.</p>
