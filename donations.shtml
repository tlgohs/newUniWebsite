					<h1>Make a Gift to Uni</h1>
<p>You are about to leave this site. You will be transferred to the University of Illinois Foundation site where you can make your gift safely and securely. Start by entering the amount you wish to donate to each of the following Uni High funds.&nbsp; Federal corporate tax ID number: 37-6006007</p>
<p><h3>Dear Uni High Alumni Parents & Friends:</h3>


As the holiday season approaches, consider making a gift from your IRA the University of Illinois Foundation designated for UI Laboratory High School. With your help we can continue to support tomorrow's leaders and innovators.

Simply contact Director of Advancement, Marianne Downey at 217-244-8586 or at  <a href="mailto:downey1@illinois.edu">downey1@illinois.edu</a>
<p>
The Details
<ul><li>You must be 70½ or older.</li>
<li>You may transfer up to $100,000 from your IRA directly to the University of Illinois Foundation designated for UI Laboratory High School.</li>
<li>If you have not yet taken your required minimum distribution for 2016, your gift can satisfy all or part of that requirement.</li>
<li>You pay no income tax on the gift. The transfer generates neither taxable income nor a tax deduction, so you benefit even if you do not itemize your tax deductions.</li></ul>
 
If you are at least 59½ but not yet 70½ you can make a charitable gift from an IRA during your lifetime, without penalty. If you take distributions from your IRA—even if paid directly to the University of Illinois Foundation designated for UI Laboratory High School — you'll have to report the distribution as taxable income on your tax return in the year of distribution. If you itemize your deductions, you can take an income tax charitable deduction for the amount of your gift.<p>

<strong>Time Is Running Out—Act Now!</strong>
For your gift to qualify in 2016, your gift must be completed by Dec. 31, 2016.<p>

Contact Director of Advancement, Marianne Downey at 217-244-8586 or at <a href="mailto:downey1@illinois.edu">downey1@illinois.edu</a> to learn more about the many ways you can make a difference at Uni High this season with a gift before the end of the year.<p>
