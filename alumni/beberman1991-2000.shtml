					At the time of the Award, Iris' book had been on the New York Times bestsellers list for four months. With more than 100,000 copies sold, it also was an international bestseller in Canada and Taiwan. An excerpt of The Rape of Nanking was published in Newsweek magazine in December 1997, and the book was about to undergo its 20th printing.

					<h1>1999 Beberman Award Winner: Hamilton O. Smith</h1>
					<p>Nobel Prize Winner Hamilton O. Smith, M.D. received the 1999 Max Beberman Distinguished Alumni Award. Smith was a microbiologist who was on the faculty of Johns Hopkins University from 1967 to 1998. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for medicine in 1978 for his role in discovering restriction enzymes, chemicals which turned out to be the tools scientists needed to cut and graft pieces of DNA. The discovery is credited with revolutionizing the field of genetic research.
					After graduating from Uni a year early in 1948, Smith did his undergraduate work at the University of Illinois and the University of California at Berkeley. He earned his medical degree from Johns Hopkins in 1956. By the time he returned to Johns Hopkins in 1967 as a faculty member, his interests had shifted to the field of genetics. Although he retired from the university in 1998, Smith is still active as a researcher - to put it mildly. As senior director of DNA resources at the biotech company Celera Genomics, he and president Craig Venter are leading an effort to sequence the human genome, described by The Baltimore Sun as "one of history's most ambitious scientific efforts."</p>
					<h1>2000 Beberman Award Winner: Mary E. Jones Clark</h1>
					<p>Mary Clark was recognized for her more than 25 years of service to the Girl Scout organization, first as a volunteer and then as a professional staff member. In fact, she says she remembers when scouting was mostly about selling cookies and camping rather than the computers, car maintenance, personal finance, science, college preparation and career exploration opportunities that now are hallmarks of the organization. Clark herself was a girl scout from third to sixth grade, while in elementary school. Her mother was a Girl Scout leader in the 1940s, before Mary was even old enough to be a Brownie or Junior Girl Scout.
					Following graduation from Uni High in 1955, Mary attended a local business college and then enrolled in college as an elementary education major. Not long after that, she met her husband, the Rev. Morris Clark. He was the pastor at the Second Baptist Church in Mattoon for 20 years before retiring and now is an associate pastor of Salem Baptist Church in Champaign. The two enjoy singing and were members of the National Council for Negro Musicians, Inc. Clark took voice lessons and from a teacher who traveled from Chicago to teach a group of Black musicians each week, and also took piano lessons for 14 years.
					The Clarks are the parents of four children, who attended the graduation ceremony with their spouses and children: The Rev. Maurice Clark of Champaign, Katheryn Clark Lewis of Mt. Juliet, TN, - who also attended Uni High in the 1970s - and twins, the Rev. Edward Clark of Stone Mountain, Ga., and Edwina Clark Hendricks of Lithonia, GA.
					Clark joined the Green Meadows Girl Scout Council professional staff in 1973 as the full-time Field Services Director. She later assumed responsibility for adult training and, in 1982, she received Girl Scouting's top award for adults at the time, the Thanks Badge. She is now Adult Education Director for the Green Meadows Council which currently involves more than 4,000 girls in 400 troops in a six-county region. Two of her granddaughters recently have become Brownies, which means four generations of Mary's family have been or are involved in Girl Scouting.</p>
