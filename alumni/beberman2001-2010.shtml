					<h1>2001 Beberman Award Winner: Terry Truitt Whitcomb</h1>
					<p>Terry Truitt Whitcomb is a professor emeritus of Art History at the University of San Diego. She also is the retired director of Institutional Design and served as curator of the University of San Diego collection of fine and decorative arts. She was chair of the University of San Diego Art Department from 1969-1990. As director of institutional design (a job that does not exist on most campuses) Professor Whitcomb has been responsible for keeping the visual surroundings of the private Roman Catholic-Affiliated university in harmony and preserving and protecting its Spanish Renaissance theme.
					Professor Whitcomb earned a Master's of Arts degree with Distinction from San Diego State University. She was the first woman to complete undergraduate studies at the then-brand new San Diego College for Women. (Later, the College for Women merged with the College for Men to become the University of San Diego.)</p>
					<h1>2002 Beberman Award Winner: Dr. James Tobin</h1>
					<p>The late James Tobin was a professor emeritus of economics at Yale University and was a top adviser in the Kennedy administration. He received the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1981. He is perhaps best known for applying economic theory to the way people make decisions and for advocating the Keynesian theory of government intervention in the economy. Throughout his career, he battled conservative economists like Milton Friedman, a Nobel laureate at the University of Chicago, who disdained government intervention. Dr. Tobin regarded his Nobel Prize as a vote of confidence in the Keynesian theory.
					In his obituary, The New York Times noted, Dr. Tobin concluded that investors were affected by their assessments of how risky their decisions might be and that they differed in the amount of risk they were willing to take. He explored the tendency to build portfolios in which risks were balanced against more secure assets. Earlier analyses frequently oversimplified the behavior, assuming that investors typically sought the highest return without regard to risk.
					But Dr. Tobin's work, known as the Portfolio Selection Theory, helped increase the understanding of an investor's willingness to hold various assets, the Times noted. During times of inflation, for instance, he found them less willing to hold stock or cash, turning instead to bonds or physical assets like real estate.
					In an update to his Yale webpage several months before his death in early 2002, Dr. Tobin said, "In my career as an economist beginning in 1939, I have done research and writing in several fields: macroeconomics theory and policy; money and banking; public finance; consumer behavior; welfare economics; rationing; portfolio selection and asset markets (commonly known as the "q" ration), economic growth; investment and capital accumulation; inequity and public policy to ameliorate poverty (the so-called negative income tax); econometric method (the Tobin analysis); and international monetary systems (related to the so-called "Tobin Tax".)
					He added that at the time, his active interests related to social security and medical care as well as international monetary reform. Dr. Tobin was the author of some 500 articles and 16 books.</p>
					<h1>2003 Beberman Award Winner: Rebecca Ayars Baker</h1>
					<p>Rebecca Ayars Baker, earned a bachelor's degree and a juris doctorate degree from the University of Illinois and was a member of the 1956 United States Olympic Women's Track Team. Today, she is Secretary of the Board of the National Credit Union Administration, the regulatory agency that oversees federal credit unions and insures the great majority of all credit unions.
					Prior to her life as a public servant, Becky was a partner in the management consulting firm Baker-Burns & Associates from 1980-1982. During that time, she co-authored and obtained copyrights on management systems for state government and presented the systems to top-level state government managers. From 1978 to 1979, she was president of the Terrace Hill Society and chaired a quasi-state government committee composed of state officials, state legislators and public representatives involved in restoring the Iowa governor's mansion. Becky Ayars Baker has been married for 45 years to Joseph Baker, former Director of Welfare for downstate Illinois, Iowa and Idaho. He then went to Washington, D.C., to work in the federal food stamp program and later with the federal Health and Human Services agency. They are the parents of three grown daughters, Betsy, Mary, and Emily, and two grandchildren, Mia and P.J.
					In 1956, Rebecca took a semester off from law school to compete on the women's track team in the Olympic Games in Melbourne, Australia. She ended up not actually getting to compete due to an inopportune case of pneumonia. She is one of a 28 local athletes listed on the Champaign Park District Tribute to Olympic Athletes monument located just off Mattis Avenue near Parkland College.
					Rebecca still enjoys running today and was nominated by her daughters in 2001 to be a torchbearer for the Salt Lake City Olympics. "It meant a lot to me," she said at the time, "because I was selected to carry the torch into the area in front of the Arlington City Hall, where a ceremony to honor the heroes of the Pentagon 9/11 rescue was held."
					"My torch is special to me because they all held it," she said.</p>
					<h1>2004 Beberman Award Winner: Jack Wills</center></h1>
					<p>The 2004 Max Beberman Distinguished Alumni Award was presented to John "Jack" Wills, a member of the Uni High Class of 1953. He earned a bachelor's degree in Philosophy (Phi Beta Kappa, Phi Kappa Phi, High Honors) in 1956, earned a master's degree in East Asian Studies from Harvard University in 1967 and a Ph.D. in history and Far Eastern Languages from Harvard University in 1967.
					Wills is a professor of history at the University of Southern California, where he has taught since 1965. A specialist in Chinese history, he has written extensively on China's relations with maritime Europeans during the years between 1500 and 1800. His books include "Mountain of Fame: Portraits in Chinese History" (Princeton University Press, 1994) and "1688: A Global History" (W.W. Norton and Granta Press, 2001). The New York Times called his journey through 5,000 years of Chinese history in "Mountain" a "spirited and highly intelligent book."
					He helped to develop a general education program that included East Asian languages, cultures and history at USC and went on to serve as acting chair of the department of East Asian languages and cultures from 1987 to 1989 and director of the East Asian Studies Center from 1990 to 1994. He wrote Mountain of Fame: Portraits in Chinese History (Princeton University Press, 1994). The New York Times called his journey through 5,000 years of Chinese history a "spirited and highly intelligent book."
					Wills has donated $50,000 to help establish a graduate research assistantship program for the East Asian Studies Center at USC. At the time he made his gift, he said he hopes this seed money encourages others to pitch in, so that students can work one-on-one with major scholars in their field of study.</p>
					<h1>2005 Beberman Award Winner: Thomas Clark Shedd</h1>
					<p>Thomas Clark Shedd, a member of the Uni High Class of 1936, was named the 2005 Beberman Distinguished Alumni Award recipient. A native of Phoenixville, PA, who now makes his home in Evanston, Tom earned a bachelor's degree in Railway-Electrical Engineering from the U of I in 1940.
					The 2005 award recipient has set a "track" record with a railroad career that spans some 55 years and includes traveling at 5 miles an hour to test rail in all 48 contiguous states as well as writing some 1,000 railroad feature articles and about 800 opinion pieces for a variety of publications, including Modern Railroads, Trains, Railway Age, the Encyclopedia Britannica, World Book Encyclopedia and Compton's Encyclopedia.

					Tom says trains have always been of interest to him, but he originally intended to pursue a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering when he left Uni for the University of Illinois.

He also began writing for Technograph, the student engineering magazine at the U of I.
