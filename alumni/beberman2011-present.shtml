					<h1>2011 Beberman Award Winner: Dr. John Finch</h1>
					<p>During John's time at Uni he was in the Mixed Chorus, Boy's Ensemble and the Madrigals. John played on the basketball and tennis teams and was the manager on the football team. That's right, they had six man football at Uni High in the 1950s! John served on the Student Council and was Vice President and President of his class.
					Upon graduating from Uni, John was accepted at Harvard, but being only 16, he decided to attend his pre-medical studies closer to home at the University of Illinois. Three years later John was accepted at Washington University Medical School in St. Louis, Missouri. John enjoyed his Pediatric Residency at the University of Oregon then volunteered to serve in the U.S. Air Force at the beginning of the Viet Nam War.
					Once he completed his service in the Air Force, John went into private practice in Pediatric Medicine. His practice was quite successful and after only a few years John was offered a fellowship in Radiology at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. John practiced Diagnostic Radiology in Florida for years including a stint as Chief of Staff at Doctors Hospital. John is a fellow of the American Academy of Pediatrics, and he is a member of the American College of Radiology, and the American Medical Association.
					Remarkably, John found time to give to his community as a past president of the Sarasota Chapter of the American Cancer Society and as a member of the organization's state board of directors.
					During his retirement John has become a world traveler who has visited each of the 7 continents. He has applied his penchant for life-long learning to studying, as he puts it, "the many cultures of our global family."
					After all of these years, John remains loyal to his Illini roots as a member of the University of Illinois Presidents Council Pentad Circle. John is a longtime supporter of Uni High and he hosts frequent reunions for his class in Florida. He has already begun plans for celebrating the Class of '52 Sixty Year Reunion!
					John Finch embarked on his relationship with University Laboratory High School and his fellow Uni alumni sixty years ago, yet his friendships endure to this day. John is the ultimate, loyal Uni alumnus. His legacy serves as a beacon for Uni's newest graduates.</p>
