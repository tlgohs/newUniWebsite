                        The Foreign Languages curriculum offers a four-year sequential program in French, German, Japanese, Spanish, and Latin. Two years of one foreign language are required for all students. Although only two are required, the vast majority of students complete four years of study in one language and many begin a second language. One may begin a second foreign language after completing two years of a first language.</p>
                    <p>
                        The primary goal of the Foreign Languages curriculum is to help students develop proficiency skills in listening, reading, writing and speaking. It is also the goal of the department to provide students an opportunity to travel abroad during their course of study. Trips are conducted in the following languages: German, Japanese, French, Latin, and Spanish. The curriculum's purpose is to increase the student's knowledge and appreciation of diverse cultures of the countries whose languages they are learning. Perhaps the best summations of our department’s goals are made by the proposed National Foreign Language Goals and Standards:
