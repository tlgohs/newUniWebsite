                    <h4><u>French, Spanish, and German 1</u></h4>
                    <p>(1 unit)</p>
                    <p>
                        First year French, Spanish, and German students will take the first steps toward learning how to communicate in another language. They learn how to greet people and what to say in everyday situations. They learn to talk about themselves, their friends and their family in the foreign language--to describe them, to tell what they like and don't like to do, how old they are, how they feel, what jobs they have or the courses they take, and the things they own. They learn how to pronounce the sounds of the language correctly and with the appropriate accent and intonation. Depending upon the language, they will be able to write lists, simple sentences, questions, and later paragraphs and short compositions. Basic word processing in the target language will also be introduced. They are able to understand what they hear others say or what they see written about these same topics. They learn ways to read some things that are new to them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In class, students may from time to time see videos and movies, glean information from language specific web sites, play games, listen to guest speakers, sing, give reports, and perform skits and role-plays. In each language class, students become acquainted with everyday life of the people whose language they are learning. They will also become familiar with the geography, national landmarks, traditions, and history of the country.
                    </p>

                    <h4><u>French, Spanish, and German 2</u></h4>
                    <p>(1 unit)</p>
                    <p>
                        In their second year of language study, French, Spanish and German students learn to express their ideas on a wider range of topics and with improved pronunciation, accent and intonation. They learn how to talk comfortably about ordinary events that happened in the past, and about what they would like to see happen in the future. They learn ways to make their ideas understood even if they may not know the exact word. They learn how to listen to the spoken language in order to follow the main message being communicated. They learn strategies for reading a text in the foreign language that may contain some unfamiliar words. They learn how to get their message across when writing paragraphs and short compositions and the elements of grammar that will enable them to express themselves clearly. Word processing in the target language, as well as the use of on-line reference materials will be covered. As in the first year class, classroom activities include games, skits, songs, reports, and films. Students continue the process of discovering the everyday life, customs, and culture of the people through the use of on-line materials and e-mail.

                    <h4><u>French, Spanish, and German 3</u></h4>
                    <p>(1 unit)</p>
                    <p>
                        Level 3 students become increasingly able to use the language to communicate a variety of messages for more extended periods of time, and with more confidence. They become more comfortable with listening to native speech and with reading unfamiliar material. They learn to express their opinions, to summarize, to give more detailed explanation and descriptions, and to create with the language. As in all levels, they learn the vocabulary and language structures necessary to express themselves clearly. Students begin to read samples from the literature of the country whose language they are learning, as well as a variety of other kinds of written texts, such as magazine articles and advertisements. Role-playing games, discussions, oral reports, and films are classroom activities typical of a third-year French and German language class. Students learn to research topics on the web and make presentations to the class using presentation software such as PowerPoint.

                    <h4><u>French, Spanish, and German 4</u></h4>
                    <p>(1 unit)</p>
                    <p>
                        In the fourth year of language study, French, German and Spanish students are able to deal with more complicated situations in the foreign language. They begin to be able to analyze what they hear and read, and to write well- organized, more detailed, and lengthier compositions. They read and discuss well-known works of literature and also read the kinds of materials that native speakers in the foreign culture might read, such as magazine and newspaper articles. They may view and discuss foreign films and television/radio broadcasts. Many of the television/radio broadcasts are accessed via the Internet. In short, Level 4 students learn that they can get along in the foreign culture with some ease.
